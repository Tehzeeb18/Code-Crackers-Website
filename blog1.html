        <p style="text-align: justify;">Today, I'm going to walk you through everything you need to know about website
            development. However, I know how overwhelming it can be to learn something new — so for those seeking a more
            streamlined and user-friendly approach, HubSpot's drag-and-drop website builder offers a practical solution,
            allowing you to focus on design and content without the need for extensive coding knowledge. This is a great
            place to start if you are just beginning your web development journey.

            If you're interested in the ins and outs of web development, I’m excited to share with you the basics of web
            development and the exhilarating process of creating a website from scratch. I remember the first website I
            ever built—it was full of bright colors and clunky animations, but it was mine, and it sparked a lifelong
            passion. Through trial and error, I've personally discovered the joy of turning complex problems into
            elegant solutions.

            Feel free to leap around the guide using the chapter links to find what you are looking for. Let's dive
            right in.

        <h3>Why is web development important?</h3>
        <p>Can you believe that we're part of a world where over 5.30 billion people are connected through the Internet?
            That's more than half of our global population, actively engaging in research, connection, education, and
            entertainment through this incredible digital universe.

            Given the rapidly increasing number of Internet users, it’s no surprise that web development is a rapidly
            expanding industry. Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to grow by 13%, much
            faster than most other technology careers. It's an exciting time to be in this field, and I'm thrilled to be
            part of this dynamic industry.</p>

        <h3>Web Development vs. Web Programming</h3>
        <p>Web development and web programming sound very similar — and they are. But there’s one very important
            distinction.

            Web development refers to the overall process of creating websites or web applications, including the
            project’s design, layout, coding, content creation, and functionality. It involves using a combination of
            programming languages, tools, and frameworks to bring a website or web application to life. It may also
            encompass project management activities, such as fielding development requests from stakeholders or
            freelance clients.

            Web programming, on the other hand, specifically refers to the coding and scripting of a website, whether
            the front-end or back-end. It primarily involves writing code to handle data, process user inputs, and
            generate dynamic content. A web programmer will rarely, if ever, handle a web development project from end
            to end. They may build a certain section of a site or troubleshoot bugs.

            Understanding this difference has been crucial in my career, allowing me to appreciate the depth and breadth
            of skills required in the world of web creation. It's a reminder of the diverse talents and expertise that
            come together to make the digital world what it is today.

        <h3>Web Development Basics</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is a website?</li>
            <li>What does front-end mean?</li>
            <li>What does back-end mean?</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h4>1. What is a website?</h4>
        <p>Websites are files stored on servers, which are computers that host (fancy term for “store files for”)
            websites. These servers are connected to a giant network called the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, how do we access these websites? This is where browsers come into play. Browsers are computer programs
            that load websites via your Internet connection, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer, while the
            computers used to access these websites are known as "clients."</p>

        <h4>2. What does front-end mean?</h4>
        <p>Front-end (or client-side) is the side of a website or software that you see and interact with as an Internet
            user. When website information is transferred from a server to a browser, front-end coding languages allow
            the website to function without having to continually “communicate” with the Internet.</p>
        <p>Front-end code allows users to interact with a website and play videos, expand or minimize images, highlight
            text, and more. Web developers who work on front-end coding work on client-side development.</p>

        <h4> What does back-end mean?</h4>
        <p>On the contrary, the back-end (or server-side) is the side that you don’t see when you use the Internet. It’s
            the digital infrastructure, and to non-developers, it looks like a bunch of numbers, letters, and symbols.

            There are more back-end coding languages than front-end languages. That’s because browsers — at the
            front-end — only understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but a server — at the back-end — can be configured to
            understand pretty much any language.</p>
